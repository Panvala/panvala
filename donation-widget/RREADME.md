## Requirements

"Donate with PAN" Widget

Create a widget that Panvala League communities can place on their own website to collect donations in PAN to a specified Ethereum address. The widget should allow the donor to send PAN that is already in their wallet, or ETH/DAI that is converted to PAN by the widget using Uniswap V2. When integrating the widget, a parameter for the default donation amount in USD should be configurable.
